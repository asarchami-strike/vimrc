# vimrc
Since I work with different vin environments and not all of them are up to date and I have to deal with it I needed a universal easy to use and forget vim config. I dont want any dependency or compilcated compilation.
This vim is based on [vim-bootstrap](http://www.vim-bootstrap.com/). I just added some minor customization.
## Install
Copy paste this command:
> `curl -o ~/.vimrc -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asarchami/vimrc/master/vimrc && vim +PlugInstall +qall`
